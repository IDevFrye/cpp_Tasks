Thomas Edison once said that the value of an idea lay in the using of it. 
In fact, ideas are translated into reality only when we act. This is what 
business and entrepreneurship is built on, remaining a relevant and important 
area of our life.

Business success is often the result of various factors that entrepreneurs need 
to consider when starting a new venture. One of the most important reasons for 
business success is to do some market research and to make a business plan. This 
will help entrepreneurs to identify their target market, analyze their competitors, 
and therefore develop a strategy to promote their product in a different way to 
different people. Moreover, another crucial factor is to manage a business properly 
and to recruit talented employees who can help to achieve the company's goals. 
Additionally, it is essential to price the product below the competitor while still 
selling at a price that covers costs. However, despite these efforts, entrepreneurs 
may still face some typical problems that can hinder their business success. Firstly, 
one of the most common issues is to depend too much on one main customer, which can 
be risky if this customer decides to stop doing business with the company. Secondly, 
another problem is to fail due to poor planning or to provide bad quality customer 
service, which can damage the company's reputation and lead to a loss of customers. 
Thirdly, entrepreneurs do not always deal with tax properly. To overcome these 
challenges, entrepreneurs need to be aware of potential problems and have a plan 
in place to address them.

Ethical dilemmas in business occur when an individual or a company is faced with a 
decision that goes against their moral values. These situations can arise due to 
various reasons such as pressure to meet targets, competition in the market or 
personal gain. Ethical dilemmas can range from small decisions such as whether 
to use environmentally friendly materials in production to more significant ones 
like whether to act illegally to gain an advantage in the market. These dilemmas 
can have an impact on a company's reputation. For example, a company that I know 
had to make a difficult ethical decision. They were offered a lucrative contract 
by a client but were asked to break the terms of the contract and bribe someone 
to secure the deal. The company had a strict policy against unethical practices. 
However, they were also facing financial difficulties. As a result, the management 
team had to weigh the pros and cons of accepting the offer and ultimately decided 
to decline it, even though it meant they would not get a decent bonus and make a 
fortune.

In fact, a business icon is someone who has achieved great success in the business 
world and is widely recognized for their accomplishments. They possess certain 
qualities that make them stand out from others, such as the ability to make tough 
decisions, take risks, and innovate. Moreover, they have also a clear vision for 
their company and are able to inspire and motivate their employees to achieve their 
goals. Another key reason for their success must be their commitment to ethical and 
responsible business practices. As an illustration, one famous Russian businessman 
who embodies these qualities is Mikhail Khodorkovsky. He built up a highly profitable 
business empire in the, starting with a small trading company and eventually 
becoming the owner of Russia's largest oil company, Yukos. Khodorkovsky was known 
for his entrepreneurial and management skills, as well as his ability to come up 
with innovative ideas for his company. He was also skilled at having a successful 
negotiation and was able to get a good deal for his company in many situations. 
Thus, his ability to think outside the box has made him a successful entrepreneur.

To sum up, I can say that business is an area of challenges and risks. If you invest 
enough effort and rush into the pool with your head, you can catch a lucky break and 
enjoy the realization of wonderful ideas.
